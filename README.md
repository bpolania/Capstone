## Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

This is the report for both the Project Proposal and the Capstone project for the Machine Learning Nanodegree in Udacity.

In order to be able to read the report and run the Python code you need the following:

* Download and Install a PDF document viewer, usually you'll have one in your computer by default, if not I recommend the latest version of Adobe Acrobar Reader, you can find it [here](https://get.adobe.com/reader/)

* Install Python 2.7, since we use Jupyter Notebooks, I recommend installing both using Anaconda, you can find it [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

* Install Jupyter, you can find the installation instructions [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#id2).

* Once everything is installed you can read the report jusy by opening the file, and run the Jupyter Notebook, you must go the console, navigate to the folder with the Udacity Machine Learning Capstone Project.ipynb and type the following command:

```
  jupyter notebook
```

It will launch in the default browser, and there you just need to click in the file name.

If you're not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, I recommend this excellent [tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook#gs.7EWmokk) by the good people of Datacamp.
